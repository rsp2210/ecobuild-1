## EcoBuild

### Problem Statement
Many people lack environmental awareness because there are no popular platforms that educate them with relevant and location-based information.

### Abstract
Climate change is one of the most alarming issues we face today, and many lack awareness on the topic. The project aims to be a source for educating people who show enthusiasm for a better cause. It includes insightful data points such as Active Wildfires, Air Quality, Power Plants, and Fuel Stations. It also provides related news articles, news, and advice; everything is based on the user's location. This information could be of great use to the general public as it can inspire the current and future generations to take action for a better future.
The algorithm could further be enhanced to include the profile of users in the analysis. So if the user is a minor, we can prioritize crimes like child abduction. 


### Approach
All the information is aggregated into maps for better visualization. The data is fetched from ArcGIS APIs in real-time, and the articles, news, and advice are fetched from the news API. All the API responses are based on the user's location. Additionally, a user authentication system is integrated into the project to ensure security. NodeJS will be used for the backend, and React will be used for the frontend.


### Persona
The project is targeted towards anyone who seeks to get environmental information around the user's location.

### Dataset links
Not applicable as data is fetched in real-time.
